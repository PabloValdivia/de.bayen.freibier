This bundle contains some fonts to use with JasperReports.

JasperReports works best (that means platform- and installation-independent)
if you use only fonts that you provide as an font extension to your
JapserReports code. This OSGi bundle contains some fonts I decided are interesting
for me to use in iDempiere reports.

You can use this bundle together with the jasper implementation bundle 
de.bayen.freibier.report.

All these fonts are from Debian packages and so can be freely used. See the debian
packages for more information on copyright.

Breip - from Debian package fonts-breip
Elegance - from Debian package fonts-linex
